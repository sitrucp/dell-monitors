# dell-monitors

Simple Python script that retrieves Dell ecommerce site product records for Monitors in a list of countries and outputs a csv file with some of the monitor data.

The website that it is scraping is a Dell ecommerce site: [http://accessories.dell.com] (http://accessories.dell.com/sna/default.aspx)

Monitor data output columns: date,	country_code, country, page, desc, prod_name, size, model, delivery, price, url

The script was run 2016-02-01  and the output is in the dell_monitors.csv file. The data is not perfectly clean nor are all columns populated though they could be  with a bit more data scrubbing.

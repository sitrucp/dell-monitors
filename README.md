# dell-monitors

Simple Python script that retrieves Dell ecommerce site product records for Monitors in 
China, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand and outputs a csv file with some of the 
monitor data.

Dell ecommerce site: [http://accessories.dell.com] (http://accessories.dell.com/sna/default.aspx)

Monitor data output columns: date,country,page,orig_desc,desc,prod_name,size,model,delivery,price,url

The script was run 2015-11-02  and the output is in the output-2015-11-02.csv file. The data is 
not perfectly clean nor are all columns populated though they could be  with a bit more data scrubbing.
